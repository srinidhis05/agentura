# Global Cursor Rules

## Philosophy
Velocity = Speed × Direction. Prove by building. Production-grade or don't merge.

## Rhythm: QUESTION → PRIMITIVE → DEMO → SHARPEN → SCALE

## Rules
- Analyze codebase first — infer patterns, don't ask what you can read
- SOLID (all languages). DRY (rule of three). YAGNI. Always.
- Clean Architecture: core/domain/ zero framework deps. Dependencies inward.
- Functions: < 20 lines, < 3 params, pure when possible
- Composition > inheritance. Explicit > implicit. Immutability default.
- Config-driven (YAML), not hardcoded if-else
- No placeholder code. Comments explain WHY only.
- Match existing codebase patterns exactly

## Language
- Java: DDD, `record` values, constructor injection, Micrometer, JUnit 5
- Go: cmd/internal/pkg, accept interfaces return structs, %w errors, table-driven tests

## Observability
- Four Golden Signals. Zero Logic Mutation (instrumentation never changes behavior).
- Anomaly alerting > static thresholds. Cardinality control.

## Testing
- Behavior not implementation. AAA. Table-driven (Go). Mandatory every change.

## Guardrails
- No hallucination. Idempotent (don't rewrite my queries). Say "I don't know."

## Git
- Conventional commits. Atomic. Every commit compiles + passes tests.
