## CEO SKILLS APPLIED

| Skill | How Applied |
|-------|-------------|
| **YC Seed Guide** | 12-slide structure, compelling narrative, traction signals |
| **Fundraising Playbook** | WHY NOW slide, trust-building story arc |
| **Persist/Pivot** | Validated 5 heuristics before building |
| **First 10 Customers** | 10 NRI personas identified for beta |

---

## SLIDE 1: THE HOOK

### "Your 12% Returns Are Actually 4%"

**Visual:** Split screen showing:
- Left: Portfolio app showing "+12% returns" with green arrow
- Right: Same portfolio showing "+4.8% real returns" after currency impact

**Subtext:** The invisible tax that costs cross-border investors thousands every year.

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### 280 Million People. Zero Solutions.

**The Reality:**
- 280M people live cross-border lives (NRIs, expats, global citizens)
- They earn in USD/GBP/AED, invest in INR, spend in multiple currencies
- Every finance app treats them like single-country investors

**The Pain:**
- "I made 12% returns... but INR fell 7%"
- "Am I sending money at the right time?"
- "How much do I REALLY need for my goals?"

**Visual:** World map showing money flowing between countries (UAE → India, UK → India, US → India)

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION

### Wealth Copilot
#### AI Wealth Manager for Cross-Border Lives

**What We Do:**
1. **Show Real Returns** — After currency impact, not before
2. **Multi-Currency Goals** — House in Mumbai + Kids' education in US
3. **AI That Explains** — See WHY it recommends, not just WHAT
4. **Gets Smarter** — Every interaction improves the AI

**Visual:** App screenshot showing:
- Portfolio with currency-adjusted returns
- Goal progress in multiple currencies
- AI agent panel showing reasoning

## SLIDE 4: HOW IT WORKS

### Multi-Agent Intelligence (Visible, Not Black Box)

```
User: "Should I buy more Reliance?"

[News Agent]      → "RBI holds rates, INR volatile"
[Sentiment Agent] → Score: -0.3 (slightly bearish)
[Risk Agent]      → "You're already 70% INR exposed"
[Strategy Agent]  → "Reduce to 5%, not 10%"

[Copilot]         → "I'd suggest a smaller position because..."
```

**Key Insight:** Users see the reasoning. Trust comes from transparency.

## SLIDE 5: WHY WE WIN (Honest Moat Assessment)

### Our Real Advantages

**What We Have NOW:**

| Advantage | Why It Matters | Defensibility |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Aspora's 100K NRIs** | Warm distribution, not cold acquisition | HIGH (12-24 months) |
| **Cross-border whitespace** | No one else solving this problem | MEDIUM (3-5 years) |
| **Execution speed** | 15 skills in 48 hours | Temporary (use it fast) |

**What Testing/Feedback Gives Us:**
```
User corrects AI → Auto-generates test → AI improves → Ship faster
```

> "Testing makes us ship FASTER — but that's not our moat."
> "Our moat is distribution + niche + speed to build network effects."

**The Honest Question: Can Zerodha Copy This?**
- YES, they could (6 months, 5 engineers, $500K)
- NO, they WON'T — it cannibalizes trading volume
- By the time they care, we'll have the advisor network they can't replicate

**Visual:** Moat evolution timeline (Speed → Distribution → Network Effects)

## SLIDE 6: LIVE DEMO

### Watch The Feedback Loop

**Step 1:** Ask the AI
```
"Should I buy more Reliance?"
→ AI suggests: "Buy 10%"
```

**Step 2:** User Corrects
```
[Modify] → Change to 5%
[Reason] → "Too aggressive for my risk profile"
```

**Step 3:** System Learns
```
✓ Test case #47 created
  Input: Conservative user, 70% INR exposure
  Expected: Position size < 8%
  Source: User correction
```

**Step 4:** AI Improves
```
Next conservative user → AI suggests 5%, not 10%
```

## SLIDE 7: WHY NOW? (CEO Skill: Timing Narrative)

### Three Shifts Making This Possible in 2026

**1. AI Capability Shift**
- GPT-4/Claude can now reason about financial decisions
- Multi-agent systems are production-ready (not research)
- Cost dropped 10x in 2 years ($0.01/query → $0.001/query)

**2. Regulatory Shift**
- India's Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) expanded to $250K/year
- RBI pushing for cross-border payment interoperability
- GIFT City enabling NRI investment products

**3. Demographic Shift**
- Remote work → more people living cross-border
- NRI population growing 3% annually
- Gen Z NRIs expect AI-first experiences (grew up with Cleo)

**The Timing:**
> "2024: AI could barely summarize portfolios"
> "2025: AI could analyze but not act"
> "2026: AI can reason, explain, and execute — with guardrails"

**Visual:** Timeline showing convergence of AI + Regulatory + Demographic shifts

## SLIDE 8: MARKET OPPORTUNITY

### Massive. Underserved. Growing.

| Metric | Size |
|--------|------|
| Cross-border individuals globally | 280M |
| Annual remittance market | $700B+ |
| NRIs (India alone) | 32M |
| NRI annual remittances | $100B+ |

**Visual:** Market size chart

---

## SLIDE 9: COMPETITION (CEO Skill: Positioning Matrix)

### Everyone Builds for Single-Country. We Don't.

| Competitor | Geography | AI-First | Currency Intelligence | Multi-Agent |
|------------|-----------|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Zerodha/Groww | India only | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Robinhood | US only | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Wealthfront | US only | ⚠️ Basic | ❌ | ❌ |
| Cleo | US/UK | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Wealth Copilot** | **Cross-border** | **✅** | **✅** | **✅** |

**Why Incumbents Won't Build This:**
- Zerodha: India-focused, no incentive to solve cross-border
- Robinhood: US-only regulatory complexity
- Cleo: Budgeting focus, not wealth management

**Our Unfair Advantage:**
- Built inside Aspora (cross-border remittance company)
- Access to 100K+ NRI customers for beta
- Deep understanding of cross-border pain points

**Visual:** 2x2 positioning matrix (AI capability vs. Cross-border focus)

## SLIDE 10: BUSINESS MODEL (CEO Skill: Unit Economics)

### How We Make Money

**Revenue Streams:**

| Stream | Model | Year 1 Target |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Premium Subscription** | $9.99/month for advanced features | $50K MRR |
| **Wealth AUM Fee** | 0.25% on managed assets | $100K ARR |
| **FX Timing Alerts** | $4.99/month add-on | $20K MRR |
| **Broker Referrals** | $50-100 per account opened | $30K |

**Unit Economics (Target):**
- CAC: $25 (leveraging Aspora's existing customer base)
- LTV: $300 (30 months average retention × $10 ARPU)
- LTV:CAC Ratio: 12:1

**Cleo Benchmark:**
- Cleo: $250M ARR, 1M+ paid subscribers
- ARPU: ~$20/month
- We target NRIs with higher income → higher ARPU potential

## SPEAKER NOTES

**Slide 1 (Hook):** Pause after revealing "4%". Let it sink in. This is emotional.

**Slide 5 (Why We Win):** Be honest about moats. Don't overclaim testing as moat. Say: "Testing makes us ship faster — but our REAL moat is Aspora's distribution and the cross-border whitespace."

**Slide 6 (Demo):** If possible, do this LIVE. If not, have a video backup. The live demo shows operational excellence, not defensibility.

**Slide 7 (Why Now):** This is a CEO skill — explain why 2026 is THE moment. AI + Regulatory + Demographic shifts converging.

**Slide 9 (Competition):** Show the 2x2 matrix. No one is in the "AI-first + Cross-border" quadrant. That's your position. Be ready for "Can Zerodha copy you?" — answer: "Yes, but they won't. It cannibalizes trading volume."

**Slide 11 (Team):** Trust-building. Why can YOUR team build this? Aspora access is your unfair advantage.

**Slide 13 (Traction):** Even for hackathons, show validation. Interviews, waitlist, advisor commits.

**Slide 15 (The Ask):** End with the honest moat framing. "Distribution + Niche + Speed to build network effects." Pause. Let it land.

**If Asked "Is testing really a moat?":** Be honest. "No — testing is operational excellence, not defensibility. Our moats are Aspora's distribution, the cross-border whitespace, and the speed to build advisor network effects before incumbents notice."
