gaps:
  code_not_in_runbooks:
    - status: SENT_TO_PROVIDER
      source: "RFIStatus.java"
      issue: "No runbook covers this RFI state"
      recommendation: "Add to rfi-pending.md as a monitoring state"

    - status: RE_OPEN
      source: "RFIStatus.java"
      issue: "No runbook covers re-opened RFIs"
      recommendation: "Add handling: treat as new REQUESTED"

    - status: PENDING_RETRY
      source: "PayoutStatus.java (Falcon)"
      issue: "Not covered in any runbook"
      recommendation: "Add to stuck-at-rda-partner.md"

    - status: ADDITIONAL_DOCUMENTS_REQUIRED
      source: "PayoutStatus.java (Falcon)"
      issue: "Falcon payout-level status, partially covered in no-rfi-created.md"
      recommendation: "Cross-link with rda-rfi.md"

    - status: VALIDATION_ON_HOLD
      source: "Falcon transaction states"
      issue: "Not in runbooks, separate from ON_HOLD"
      recommendation: "Add to falcon-failed.md"

  runbooks_not_in_code:
    - stuck_reason: carrier_exception
      runbook: "runbooks/carrier-exception.md"
      issue: "No corresponding code path found in any repo"
      recommendation: "Verify if this is still relevant"

    - stuck_reason: out_of_stock
      runbook: "runbooks/out-of-stock.md"
      issue: "No corresponding code path found (seems e-commerce, not remittance)"
      recommendation: "May be legacy, consider removing"

  discrepancies:
    - area: "RFI status naming"
      code: "REJECTED means 'requested retry from user' (not permanent)"
      docs: "Runbooks treat REJECTED as permanent rejection"
      resolution: "Clarify in runbooks that REJECTED = retry requested. FAILED = permanent."

    - area: "Order status in app-server vs GOMS"
      code: "app-server has 9 states, GOMS has 20+ workflow states per region"
      docs: "Runbooks reference a mix of both"
      resolution: "Runbooks should specify which state machine they reference"

  missing_coverage:
    - scenario: "What if RFI is rejected twice?"
      covered: false
      recommendation: "Add escalation path: 2nd rejection → call customer → 3rd → cancel"

    - scenario: "What if payment succeeds but fulfillment partner is completely down?"
      covered: false
      recommendation: "Add runbook for partner outage with refund trigger after SLA"

    - scenario: "What if LULU auto-cancels but payment was already captured?"
      covered: "Partially in excess-credit.md"
      recommendation: "Explicit cross-link from rfi-pending.md"

    - scenario: "What if Falcon payout completes on partner side but Falcon shows ATTEMPTING_PAYOUT?"
      covered: false
      recommendation: "Add to falcon-failed.md: force-update via admin API"

    - scenario: "Order exists in GOMS but no downstream system has a record (no falcon, no lulu, no payout, no payment completed)"
      covered: false
      recommendation: "Dead orders. Flag for engineering cleanup. Do NOT assign to ops agents — no action possible."
