## Template Guardrails

These apply to all skills. Add skill-specific guardrails as you learn from production.

### GR-001: Never Override Budget Limits

**Mistake**: Allowing skill execution beyond cost_budget
**Impact**: Runaway LLM costs
**Rule**: ALWAYS enforce cost_budget from agentura.config.yaml
**Detection**: Observability metric: cost_dollars counter

### GR-002: Always Log Reasoning Trace

**Mistake**: Returning output without reasoning_trace
**Impact**: Cannot debug or improve skill decisions
**Rule**: ALWAYS populate reasoning_trace in SkillResult
**Detection**: DeepEval test checks reasoning_trace is non-empty
