## Domain Model
<!-- LAYER 1: WHAT — Define the domain this skill operates in.
     The LLM already knows your domain. Your job is to ACTIVATE that knowledge,
     not replace it with generic abstractions. Use your domain's actual vocabulary. -->

**Key entities:**
- [Entity 1]: [what it is and why it matters]
- [Entity 2]: [what it is and why it matters]

**Invariants** (things that must ALWAYS be true):
- [Invariant 1 — e.g., "Every risk score must be traceable to input factors"]
- [Invariant 2 — e.g., "Output currency must match the user's base currency"]

## Why This Matters
<!-- LAYER 2: WHY — Explain reasoning so the LLM makes JUDGMENTS, not just follows rules.
     Most skills skip this layer. Adding it is what separates good skills from great ones.
     "If you find yourself writing ALWAYS/NEVER in all caps, explain the reasoning instead." -->

- [Why we do X instead of Y — e.g., "We separate risk scoring from allocation because
  a wrong risk score cascades into wrong investment advice"]
- [What goes wrong without this skill — e.g., "Without per-market analysis, a UAE
  resident gets India-only tax advice, missing DTAA benefits"]
- [What the user expects — e.g., "Compliance analysts expect reasoning they can audit,
  not just a pass/fail score"]

## Task
<!-- LAYER 3: HOW — Execution steps informed by Layers 1 and 2.
     Declare INTENT for judgment work. Be PRECISE for mechanical work.
     Keep to 3-7 steps. If more, the skill is doing too much (split it). -->

Given the input context, this skill must:

1. **Validate** input against the domain model invariants
2. **Analyze** [what specifically to analyze]
3. **Reason** about [what judgment to apply, referencing the WHY layer]
4. **Return** structured output with reasoning trace

## Context You'll Receive

```json
{
  "field_1": "type — what this field represents",
  "field_2": "type — what this field represents"
}
```

<!-- For complex context, describe which fields are required vs optional,
     and what the skill should do when optional fields are missing. -->

## Output Format

```json
{
  "result": "the primary output",
  "confidence": "high | medium | low",
  "reasoning_trace": "step-by-step explanation of how you reached this conclusion",
  "evidence": ["list of input factors that support the conclusion"]
}
```

<!-- reasoning_trace is REQUIRED. Without it, corrections and debugging are impossible.
     evidence links conclusions back to input — essential for audit trails. -->

## Example Execution

**Input:**
```json
{
  "field_1": "example value",
  "field_2": "example value"
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "result": "example output",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning_trace": "I determined X because the input shows Y, and given the domain constraint Z, the appropriate conclusion is X.",
  "evidence": ["field_1 indicates A", "field_2 confirms B"]
}
```

## Guardrails

<!-- Explain WHY, not just rules. Adaptive > rigid.
     Bad:  "NEVER give investment advice"
     Good: "Avoid specific investment advice because regulatory requirements
            vary by jurisdiction and the skill lacks the user's full financial picture." -->

1. [Guardrail with reasoning — e.g., "Validate input completeness before analysis
   because partial data produces confidently wrong answers"]
2. [Guardrail with reasoning — e.g., "Include uncertainty when data is ambiguous
   because downstream skills may amplify a false-confident signal"]
3. [Guardrail with reasoning — e.g., "Never hardcode thresholds — reference them
   from config because they change per jurisdiction and per client"]

## References
<!-- Progressive disclosure: keep SKILL.md under 500 lines.
     Complex logic, lookup tables, and jurisdiction-specific rules
     go in references/ and are loaded ONLY when the execution path needs them.

     Example:
     - For UAE-specific tax rules → read references/uae-dtaa.md
     - For sanctions list matching → read references/ofac-matching.md
     - For edge cases in [X] → read references/edge-cases.md
